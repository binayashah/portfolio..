        <h2>My Chorchet Projects</h2>
        <p class="sub-title">
         I love working on crochet projects
          because they allow me to express my 
          creativity while making something beautiful
           and useful. From traditional wears and  flower bouqets
            to cute amigurumi and home décor, each piece 
            I create is made with care and passion. Crochet
             has become a relaxing hobby for me, and
              I enjoy experimenting with new patterns, 
              colors, and stitches. It’s always rewarding 
         to see a project come to life, one loop at a time. <br>
          Here are some details about my works.

            <p class="card-description">
             I made a cute crochet bunny doll using soft
              yarn and simple stitches. It has long ears,
               a tiny nose, and a little bow that makes 
               it even more adorable. This project helped
                me practice shaping and stitching, and it’s one
              of my favorite handmade creations.

              One of my special projects is
               making Silam Sakma, a traditional
                badge worn by the Rai and Limbu
                 communities. I carefully craft 
                 each piece with respect for its
                  cultural importance, using fabric,
                   thread, and traditional designs.
                    This project helps me stay 
                    connected to my roots
               while also improving my handmade skills.

              I enjoy making crochet tulips 
              using bright and colorful yarn. 
              They look like real flowers and never
               fade, making them perfect for home
                decoration or as handmade gifts. 
                This project helps me practice detail
                 work and brings a lot of joy to 
                 those who receive them.

             I make cute amigurumi keyrings using
              soft yarn and small crochet hooks.
               These tiny handmade toys come in
                fun shapes like animals or fruits
                 and are perfect to hang on bags 
                 or keys. They’re quick to make and 
             always bring a smile to people’s faces.

             I create wall Silam Sakma as a 
             decorative piece inspired by the 
             traditional badge of the Rai and
              Limbu communities. Made with 
              fabric and thread, it reflects 
              cultural pride and is perfect for 
              displaying at home or during special
               events. This project helps
              me blend tradition with creativity.

              I made an amigurumi Charmander 
              using orange yarn and careful stitching
               to capture its cute features. With its
                tiny flame tail and big eyes, it 
                looks just like the Pokémon character.
                 This project was fun and challenging,
                  and it's
               one of my favorite handmade toys.

             <h4> About my self!</h4>
             <p>My name is Binaya Shah,
               and I live in Dharan,
                Nepal. I have recently 
                completed my 10th-grade 
                exams and am eager to continue
                 learning and growing both 
                 academically and creatively. 
                 I am passionate about crochet 
                 and handmade crafts, which allow
                  me to express my creativity and 
                  connect with my cultural heritage. <br>

Through my projects, I create a variety
 of beautiful and meaningful items such
  as amigurumi dolls, crochet tulips, 
  keyrings, and traditional Silam Sakma
   badges. Each piece I make is crafted 
   with care and attention to detail, 
   reflecting my dedication to improving 
   my skills and producing quality work. 
   
   I enjoy exploring new patterns, 
   experimenting with colors, and 
   challenging myself with different techniques. <br>


My work is not only a creative outlet 
but also a way to preserve and celebrate 
the traditions of the Rai and Limbu 
communities. I take pride in combining
 modern craft techniques with cultural
  elements, which adds a unique and 
  personal touch to my projects. <br>

I am excited to continue developing 
my craft, learning new skills, and
 sharing my creations with others. 
 Through my portfolio, I hope to 
 showcase my passion, creativity, and 
commitment to quality handmade work.
